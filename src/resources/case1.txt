The Sabotaged Spaceship
Chief Engineer Harris was found dead in the engine room. His helmet was shattered and oxygen supply sabotaged. Initial investigation suggests foul play. The victim's last access logs show unusual activity prior to the incident. Note found in trash: "The reactor must fail, They can't complete the mission."
Peter:Quiet mechanic, always tinkering with the ship's wiring. His gloves were stained with grease.
John:Security officer, overly protective of the ship's systems. He was the last one to see Harris alive.
Samantha:The medic, usually calm but her hands were shaking when questioned.
